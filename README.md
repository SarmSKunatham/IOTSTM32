# IOT STM32 Nucleo F411RE

Midterm project in IOT class

### GOAL

The `goal` is to implement a solution that correspond to Chatchard Policy. Our project proposes the idea to create a Waste Sorting Model and Developing Comprehensive Waste Sorting at the District Level. Garbage management has been a huge problem for BMA which needed over 12000 million baht to solve it. Therefore, in order to follow the SDGs and BCGs BMA must focus on **improving upstream waste management through proper waste sorting.** So, to manage waste more efficiently, we suggest **separating the waste at the garbage can rather than separating it at the garbage plant** which can reduce the time, labour and revenue spent on the waste separating process. Moreover, currently, **Bangkok only has 3 garbage plants which can not handle waste entirely** and need to use the method of landfill rather than RDF which can turn waste into a new source of fuel. 

### Solution

Our project aims to help with the goal of the **BMA garbage management** plan. For this project, we build a  garbage sorting device which applies the knowledge of Coding and programming through the STM32  microcontroller, we use 4 types of actuators and sensors; **servo motor, dc motor, ultrasonic sensor and IR sensor to sort and separate garbage** into a different category so that waste can be processed more efficiently.

### Future Work

- Garbage category sorting using image processing  
- utilizing the concept of IOT by connecting the data through cloud
- Visualize the data to handle garbage management better
- Able to separate recycleable garbage from the rest
